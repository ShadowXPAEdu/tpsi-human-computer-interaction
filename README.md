# Human Computer Interactions

This subject introduced fundamental concepts of human-computer interaction used in the development of applications.

## Assignment

This subject had three assignments.

The objective of the first assignment was to identify three examples of user interactions. One example of an everyday object that reflects a bad interaction, and two other examples where there is a bad interface on a computer device (computer, mobile phone, PDA, etc.). The assignment was done in teams of two.  

The second assignment was to provide a general explanation of its relevance, the considerations to take into account for a good interaction, a good and a bad example along with an explanation that justifies the arguments. The assignment was done in teams of two.  

The [third and final assignment](Assignment.pdf) was to create a graphic interface with **Scratch**. The theme of the project was chosen by the group. This project had to include at least one type of user with special needs. The assignment was done in teams of two.
